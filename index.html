And she is the founding author of ‘the medicine bag’ which is showing that you shouldn’t fear who you are.Paragraph 1The author of this text tried to make the readers understand about what the concept of identity is by talking about a boy name Martin whose grampa came over and gave Martin a medical bag as a gift. Martin was ashamed of his grampa which shows that people are usually pressured to not accept their culture due to them being scared that they would be mad fun of because of their cultural identity. Later Martins friends come over and they really enjoy spending time with his grampa which made him happy, and he was no longer too afraid and was able to accept his own culture and his own traditions. The author used language features like nouns and adverbs to show cultural respect and traditional following(Like she is following a culture herself). I have learned that people can be rude about your culture for not fitting in which has been happening for years, but when they meet you and get to know you their mindset changes. I have learned that people only discriminate because they are trying to fit in as well.Conclusion The medicine bag is a great story and can really change someone’s life that consists of hiding their identity, Culture and their traditions.', '/assets/media/hey.jpg', 'white')">The Medicine Bag</button>

Uncle Bob Randal Tries to get the viewers to understand his connection with the land around him and how he can never feel alone when he has ancestors all around him. The importance of the place and the connections is high because his family has been there, and it is his land for decades and decades.In ‘the land owns us’, you can see some significant visual features like a red sand lizard, red sand, and Uluru. There is also a blue sky and lots of short sandy trees. The visual features can help support his point by the fact that many people would rather live in an urbanized area rather than living in a hot desert, which shows that Uluru is more his family’s land rather than other people’s land. The visual area is important because its show’s his connection to the land and the spirits of his ancestors. The visual area helps us understand that people can have a very large connection with the land.The land is inherited by lots of Uncle Bob Randal’s ancestor’s which he couldn’t be happier about. The way he smiles often is what affects me, he just seems so happy which makes me feel like I would want to fly/drive there to experience it. Uncle Bob Randal has a very big connection with the land he lives on, and he would try to never lose it. The texts identifies that his connection to place and country is strong. It is important to have a connection to the country/land because you are responsible for your land.', '/assets/media/stuff.jpg')">Uncle Bob Randal</button>

She mentions a lot about the land in her poem. The poem consists of her using the word ‘Remember’ hence the name of the poem. Her poem can have meaning for the concept of belonging because she feels like the land belongs to her because she says ‘Remember the earths whose skin you are: red earth, black earth, yellow earth and white earth’ and ‘Remember you are this universe and this universe is you’.Harjo has a lot of repetition and metaphors in her poem. Repetition emphasises the meaning/ connects to family and gratitude like when she says ‘Remember your father. He is your life, and your life is his life’ and ‘Remember your birth, how your mother struggled to give you form and breath. You are evidence of her life and her mother’s and Hers’. The meaning of the poem links to belonging by showing that she belongs to someone, and someone belongs to her that includes her culture and her family because she said ‘Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them, Listen to them. They are alive poems’.The most impactful thing about her poem is that she uses ‘remember’ a lot so the reader will see that Joy Harjo is displaying different parts of her life and how she experienced everything as she also learned her culture through her life .', '/assets/media/images.jpg')">Belonging</button>
